# Jupyter extra tools

This package is oriented for those who are making machine learning on Jupyter Lab.

This is not a Jupyter extension, but some function to import to make some nice operations as showing tensorflow graphs inline, or to nicely display scikit-learn dataset documentation.

The package will receive others functionalities as soon as I can.
